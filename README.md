# Georgia_Tech_Final_Project
This repository contains all of the deliverables for my final project from the Georgia institute of Technology Cybersecurity Bootcamp

In this final project I was tasked with conducting three different engagements:

    - An offensive engagement where I was asked to infiltrate a vulnerable network and capture 4 flags
    - A defensive engagement where I needed to setup watchers in Elasticsearch to monitor for potential attacks
    - A network analysis engagement where I had to use wireshark to assess malicious network traffic


Listed here is the [Offensive_Enagement](https://github.com/AustinBarrett2282/Georgia_Tech_Final_Project/blob/main/Offensive%20Engagement/Red_Team_Engagement.md), the [Defensive_Engagement](https://github.com/AustinBarrett2282/Georgia_Tech_Final_Project/blob/main/Defensive%20Engagement/Blue_Team_Engagement.md), and the [Network_Analysis](https://github.com/AustinBarrett2282/Georgia_Tech_Final_Project/blob/main/Network%20Analysis/Network%20Analysis.md)

While all of the engagements were done individually, I did participate in a group to come up with presentation slides for the offensive engagement. Those can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XiA0sMphfrkpX7FVCqIpAnb_YqwRowvt7KURH1qngmE/edit#slide=id.g8bd883d690_5_3101)
